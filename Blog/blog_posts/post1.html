                <div class="blogtext">
                    <p>Well, it looks like this is going to be the first blog post of my blog. I mean, it's fitting - why not talk about how I designed and created my blog as my blog's first post?</p>

                    <p>I'm planning on my blog being part of my overall Portfolio site. However, I'm behind on getting my Portfolio site finished, and I'm simultaneously ready to start blogging. So I'll go ahead and start the blog and add on the rest as I complete it.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Initial Concept</h3>
                    <p>As I mentioned earlier, I want a blog on my official Portfolio site. In a nutshell, I'm planning on using this blog to create "Project Breakdowns" (in-depth looks at how I create my various projects) and posts about me learning how to program. Maybe someday, when I feel like I'm more of a professional, I'll start posting tutorials, guides, opinion pieces, etc. For now, my blog is all about me learning.</p>
                    
                    <p>I almost created a blog via Wix. I've used their site builder in the past (back before I started coding). However, while I was working on creating that blog, I thought to myself, "What am I doing? I know how to use HTML and CSS extremely well, and I'm getting the web part of JavaScript down, too." And thus, I decided to code my own blog.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>I began with some ideas and sketches on paper.</p>
                    
                    (screenshot)
                    
                    <p>Then I decided to create a "mockup" of sorts of how I wanted my blog to look. It took a few hours of styling and fiddling, but this is what I ended up with. I'm pretty damn happy with it:</p>
                    
                    (screenshot)
                    
                    <p>Granted, this obviously isn't 100% complete. The top bar will, of course, be my navbar, and I want to implement my own Comments section once I learn PHP and SQL (which I belive are what is needed for a Comments section; one that lasts longer than a page refresh or deletion of local storage, anyway).</p>
                    
                    <p>Normally, I would share JavaScript code and give an in-depth analysis on the creation of the code, my thought processes, bugs and how I fixed them, etc. However, thus far, my blog mockup hasn't required any JavaScript. I might need to implement my newly-acquired localStorage knowledge for something (although for what, I'm not sureâ€¦ my first localStorage use may just be oen of my side projects after all). I know I'll have to use JS to perhaps do something with the Search bar (cause it's totally fake at the moment), as well as the Categories counts, and maybe the Next/Previous Post links (because that is something I would much rather automate than individually code every single time).</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <h3>Update - Golden Ratio</h3>
                    
                    <p>So I've done a bit of editing to my blog mockup. I fell into a bit of a Google search rabbit hole a couple of hours ago - beginning with researching why the majority of websites use some variation of gray as their font color instead of black. The search for "gray text not black" generated this as a result: 7 Deadly Web Design Sins You Might Be Making. Color me intrigued. I clicked on it and read it (decent article!).</p>
                    
                    <p>A little over halfway into the article, the author mentions the Golden Ratio, which is something I'd never actually heard of, as far as my present memory knows. Specifically, he suggests using the Golden Ratio to design certain aspects of your website, such as your font's line height. Some side googling led me to multiple sources reporting that setting your line height at 168% not only sets your current font size to the "golden ratio line height", but any size, a la responsive web design. (Yay percentages!)</p>
                    
                    <p>I continued to read up on the Golden Ratio, and researched using it in web design. I don't have a "natural knack" for web design (or visual art, for that matter), so any additional help I can get is always appreciated. I am a sponge waiting to absorb all of your tips, tricks, and knowledge. Hydrate me. </p>
                    
                    <p>Long story short, my website went from this:</p>
                    
                    (original)
                    
                    <p>To this:</p>
                    
                    (2nd - darker background)
                    
                    <p>To this:</p>
                    
                    (Golden Ratio)
                    
                    <p>I have to say, I think there is definitely something to this Golden Ratio theory. I applied it to not only my line height, but also the page's overall layout, as well as the font and heading sizes. Comparing before Golden Ratio and after Golden Ratio, the version with the Golden Ratio applied does look even better! I'm very impressed!</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <h3>Next Step</h3>
                    
                    <p>At this point, I am extremely happy with how my mockup turned out. It's time for me to build the real thing! I can't say for sure if I'll end up changing anything (I always inevitably change something during the journey) but my goal is to simply get it functioning as an actual blog. Oh, wait. That means I have to build the "Blog List" (the page that leads to the blog posts). Dammit! It's 6:40am and I've been up all night. I mean, I'm happy to do so, but I wasn't expecting another equally-sized project. I do have some sort of semblance of how I want my Blog List page to be paid out. However, it isn't a fully fledged-out plan.</p>
